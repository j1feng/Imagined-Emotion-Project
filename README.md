# cogs189-eeg


A EEG project made for my course COGS 189

Since we have experience in data science and machine learning we decided to find an EEG signal dataset, and generate meaningful results through Python on Jupyter Notebook.
By Mondy 2/3, we have narrowed down our project to two potential datasets. We may use the Imagined Emotion dataset or the MNIST Brain Digit dataset.  In the Imagined Emotion set, we will be using EEG data in order to predict the emotional feeling that the subject was imagining in the course of the experiment.  With the MNIST Brain Digit dataset, the goal will be to classify EEG signals into digits 0-9.  Regardless of which dataset we decide on, we will need to process the data and remove noise.

[Updated at final week: we have used the machine learning algorithm for the imagined emotion dataset. Now we can classify if the patients are feeling positive or negative, and predict what kind of emotion the patient is feeling]

Datasets:
